## Introduction to our interdisciplinary project 

Since the first outbreak of COVID-19 and the start of the pandemic in 2020, governments and various pharmaceutical companies around the world have collaborated for the development of vaccines against COVID-19. The first vaccine to be approved was the CanSino vaccine in China which was used by the military [3]. Since then, many different types of vaccines have been developed from big pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer–BioNTech (mRNA vaccine), Johnson & Johnson (modified adenovirus vaccine), AstraZeneca (modified adenovirus vaccine) and Moderna (mRNA vaccine). COVID-19 vaccines have shown to be effective in the protection against the disease. For example, previous clinical trials have shown Pfizer’s vaccine to have up to 95%[1, 4]. Nonetheless, these statistics have changed with age and the emergence of variants of concern [2]. Also, it is still difficult to predict the effectiveness of the same vaccine administered to another population [1]. We think investigating and building a model for the observed effectiveness could be a good start. Therefore, in this project, we aim to produce a statistical model to measure an impact of age as a factor in the vaccines’ effectiveness in protecting against COVID-19.

By first reading and understanding tha data from NHS, a statistical analysis in Python, including tests and plots will follow, in order to answer the research question.
