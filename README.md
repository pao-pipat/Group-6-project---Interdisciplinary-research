## Introduction to our project 

Since the first outbreak of COVID-19 and the start of the pandemic in 2020, gouvernements and various pharmaceutical companies around the world have collaborated for the development of vaccines against COVID-19. The first vaccine to be approved was the CanSino vaccine in China which was used in the military. Since then, many different types of vaccines have been developed from big pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer–BioNTech (mRNA vaccine), Johnson & Johnson (modified adenovirus vaccine), AstraZeneca (modified adenovirus vaccine) and Moderna (mRNA vaccine). COVID-19 vaccines have shown to be effective in the protection against the disease. For example, previous clinical trials have shown Pfizer’s vaccine to have up to 95%. Nonetheless, those statistics have changed with the discovery of variants of the virus. The effectiveness of those vaccines depending on the age group of the population receiving it is not something that has been well researched, which is why we thought it could be interesting to produce statistical analysis to see if age is a factor in the Pfizer’s vaccine efficacy in the protection against covid.
