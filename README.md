# Interdisciplinary Research Computing project: Validating efficacy and effectiveness of the current COVID-19 vaccines on different age groups 

# A bit about ourselves 
We are four second year students at Imperial College London: Nine Kinnman, Nichakorn Pipatpadungsin (Pao), Jialin Liu (Lester) and Christoforos Georgios Fistouris. Each studying different subject, we brought our skills together to create this project, which combined mathematics, medical sciences, and computer sciences. 

## Introduction to our interdisciplinary project 
Since the first outbreak of COVID-19 and the start of the pandemic in 2020, governments and various pharmaceutical companies around the world have collaborated for the development of vaccines against COVID-19. The first vaccine to be approved was the CanSino vaccine in China which was used by the military [3]. Since then, many different types of vaccines have been developed from big pharmaceutical companies, such as Pfizer–BioNTech (mRNA vaccine), Johnson & Johnson (modified adenovirus vaccine), AstraZeneca (modified adenovirus vaccine) and Moderna (mRNA vaccine). COVID-19 vaccines have shown to be effective in the protection against the disease. For example, previous clinical trials have shown Pfizer’s vaccine to have up to 95%[1, 4]. Nonetheless, these statistics have changed with age and the emergence of variants of concern [2]. Also, it is still difficult to predict the effectiveness of the same vaccine administered to another population [1]. We think investigating and building a model for the observed effectiveness could be a good start. Therefore, in this project, we aim to produce a statistical model to measure an impact of age as a factor in the vaccines’ effectiveness in protecting against COVID-19.

# Our research question
Can we get the same efficacy and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines observed in the clinical trials using our statistical analysis and does it vary depending on the age of the population receiving it? 

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
By first reading and understanding tha data from NHS, a statistical analysis in Python, including tests and plots will follow, in order to answer the research question.
